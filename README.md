# Ramp CTF Challenge Solution

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the Ramp CTF Challenge, part of my application for the Software Engineer position at Ramp. The challenge involved extracting a hidden URL from a webpage, fetching a flag from that URL, and displaying it in a React application with specific rendering requirements.

I had a lot of fun tackling this challenge from beginning to end and truly believe all software engineer applications should include a challenge like this. 

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Leveraged modern JavaScript features.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic markup and styling defaulted from Vite boilerplate. 

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apricot.git
   cd apricot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application:**

   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the application. Locate the accurate link given from Vite. 

## Building the Application
To create a production-ready build of the application, use:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a production build in the build/ directory.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Clean Code:** Ensured code readability with meaningful variable names and comments.
- **No External Libraries:** Used only React and browser APIs as per the requirements.
- **State Management:** Managed loading states effectively to enhance user experience.

## Conclusion

This challenge was an exciting opportunity to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and proficiency with React and JavaScript. Thank you to the team that created this fun challenge and I look forward to the possibility of contributing my skills to the Ramp team!
